netdaemon

Asynchronous control of persistent daemon processes.

netdaemon is a daemon program that offers an remote/asynchronous API for running and controlling a set of other
processes. Included is also a client library and command-line utility.

The daemon runs a set of background processes which are attached to the daemon, and then clients may connect to the
daemon and issue commands to control these processes. The daemon offers the following aspects of control:
    * exec path (direct filesystem path)
    * exec arguments
    * exec environment

    * sending signals
    * watching status
