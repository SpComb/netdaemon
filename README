netdaemon

Asynchronous control of persistent daemon processes.

netdaemon is a daemon program that offers an remote/asynchronous API for running and controlling a set of other
processes. Included is also a client library and command-line utility.

The daemon runs a set of background processes which are attached to the daemon, and then clients may connect to the
daemon and issue commands to control these processes. The daemon offers the following aspects of control:
    * exec path (direct filesystem path)
    * exec arguments
    * exec environment
    * sending signals
    * watching status

Each connection to the daemon undergoes protocol handshake and authentication stages before proceeding to actual
operation.

In operational mode, the client can:
    * query the listing of active processes
    * attach to a running process
    * perform operations on the attached process and recieve operational status
        * send data to stdin
        * recieve data from stdout/stderr
        * send signals
        * recieve process status updates (killed, termination, etc.)
    * detach from the process and attach to a new one
    * start a new process (and attach to it)

Each client connection can, at most, be attached to one process at a time.

Each process initiated has an unique ID handle associated with it, which can be used by the clients to identify and
attach to a process after starting one and reconnecting.

To start a process or attach to one, the daemon performs authorization of the process's permissions against the client's
authenticated user.

TODO:
    * daemon: resolve behaviour of select_loop_del as regards calling from within select_loop_run
    * client: ordering of on_exit/on_stdout_eof to only exit once process has exited AND we have EOF on both
